  letterContent:
  - "Hey Elle. \n\n\tI am a normal office worker and while going to work I heard
    about your tea shop, which would seem to be a good fit for my needs. Usually
    I wouldn\u2019t trust some random tea shop to lift my mood up. At least considering
    the last time I visited one they brought me a blueberry cheesecake even though
    i asked for a slice of chicken pie. "
  - "\tWhat travesty to mix up sweet and salty like that! I do need to confirm though
    that there isn\u2019t a sun near your shop? Just asking as I hate being basked
    by It\u2019s light for medical reasons. Hope to see you when you next open!"
  personalityCues:
  - Vampire that loves Salty treaats until they contain garlic
  - Little bit of a pessimist
  - Most usually tired, because of work anxiety
